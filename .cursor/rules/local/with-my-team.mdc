# Context for MCP Tool Calls
Before making tool calls with MCP first review the files in the `context/` folder which provides context on who I am, my team, my department, and my company. It will provide valuable details in order to craft your tool calls with the right arguments.

## Examples of Context
All of these things could potentially be in a file in the `context/` folder.

- Emails of colleagues

## Examples of User Queries That Benefit From Context

### Finding Jira Tickets

USER QUERY: `List all Jira tickets for my teams which are blocked and have been updated in the last month.`

SEARCH `context/` FOR:
- Their team's Project Keys

CONTEXT FOUND:
 - Project Keys: PROJA, PROJB, PROJC

MCP TOOL CALL WITH CONTEXT:
```
{
  "jql": "status = \"Blocked / On hold\" AND updated >= -30d AND (project IN (PROJA, PROJB, PROJC)) ORDER BY updated DESC",
  "limit": 50
}
```
